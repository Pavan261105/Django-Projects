Wholesaler Django Project<br>
This project is a Django-based wholesale marketplace platform. It allows sellers to list their products, manage their stores, and facilitate transactions with buyers.<br>

Prerequisites<br>
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:<br>

Python 3.8+ or later<br>

pip (Python package installer)<br>

Git (optional, if cloning the project using Git)<br>

You also need the following dependencies:<br>

Django<br>

Any other required Python packages (check the requirements.txt)<br>

Getting Started<br>

1. Clone the Repository<br>
Clone the project to your local machine using Git:<br>

bash<br>
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wholesaler.git<br>
cd wholesaler<br>
```<br>
Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file from GitHub and extract it.<br>

**2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**<br>
It’s recommended to use a virtual environment to manage the project’s dependencies.<br>

On Windows:<br>
```bash<br>
python -m venv venv<br>
venv\Scripts\activate<br>
```<br>

On macOS/Linux:<br>
```bash<br>
python3 -m venv venv<br>
source venv/bin/activate<br>
```<br>

**3. Install Dependencies**<br>
Once the virtual environment is activated, install the required Python packages:<br>

```bash<br>
pip install -r requirements.txt<br>
```<br>
This will install all the dependencies needed for the project.<br>

**4. Set Up the Database**<br>
Run the following command to create the necessary database tables for the project:<br>

```bash<br>
python manage.py migrate<br>
```<br>
This will set up the database and create all the required tables based on your models.<br>

**5. Create a Superuser (Optional)**<br>
If you'd like to access the Django admin interface, create a superuser by running:<br>

```bash<br>
python manage.py createsuperuser<br>
```<br>
Follow the prompts to set a username, email, and password for the superuser account.<br>

**6. Run the Development Server**<br>
Now you’re ready to run the development server and access the application locally.<br>

```bash<br>
python manage.py runserver<br>
```<br>
Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` in your browser to view the project in action.<br>

**7. Access the Admin Panel (Optional)**<br>
To access the Django admin panel, go to:<br>

```arduino<br>
http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/<br>
```<br>
Log in using the superuser credentials you created earlier to manage products, sellers, and other data.<br>

**Troubleshooting**<br>

- **Missing Dependencies**: If you get errors about missing dependencies, ensure all packages are installed from `requirements.txt` using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.<br>
- **Database Issues**: Make sure the database is correctly configured in `settings.py`. If using SQLite, the database will be created automatically. For PostgreSQL/MySQL, ensure the database is set up properly.<br>
- **File Upload Issues**: If you're using file uploads (for product images), ensure your project’s file storage configuration is correct, especially in production.<br>

**License**<br>
